# Bitcoin Merit Badges
https://BitcoinMeritBadges.com

Bitcoin Merit Badges are a fun way to set goals for your contributions to the Bitcoin community, and brag about important achievements you have already made.
Merit badges are not verified, although we may implement a "report fraud" function at some point.
For now, it is just for fun and is based on the *honor system.*

Eventually users will be able to link their twitter, github or reddit profiles similar to the verification methods employed by Keybase.
Users can create profiles on bitcoinmeritbadges.com, create their own "milestone list" and post to twitter when they earn a new badge.

The project is open-source and there will be an effort to include artists from the Bitcoin community to contribute graphics and new merit badge milestones.
The examples below use emojis to get started. Eventually there will be a directory in this repo containing unique images for each badge,
with full (500x500) and thumbnail (100x100) versions.
